# The CanDIG Project
## National Genomic Analysis for a Federal Canada

This is a talk for the [Ontario ARC Congress](http://ontarioarccongress.ca), Toronto, May 17 2018, on the [CanDIG project](http://distributedgenomics.ca).

Tackling the &ldquo;wicked problems&rdquo; of cancer and rare
diseases against the already complex landscape of human biology
requires health researchers to have access to as much health and
genomic data as possible in order to see connections and test
hypotheses. While a torrent of genomic data is now being produced
at sites across Canada, accessibility to researchers means more
than having it sit on a disk somewhere with the right permission
bits set. It has to be discoverable, analyzable, available, and
linked to vital metadata for it to be useful in improving human
health.

In this talk we present the Canadian Distributed Infrastructure for
Genomics (CanDIG, http://distributedgenomics.ca ), a fully distributed
platform that allows national-scale, privacy-maintaining analyses
of locally-controlled data sets. CanDIG is a CFI Cyberinfrastructure-funded
project with initial sites in Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver.
With participating members including the top generators of genomic
data for Canadian patients, CanDIG will serve as a foundational
platform for all of these institutions collaborative ventures, with
a long-term goal of extending data sharing to a wider base of
researchers across Canada.

The CanDIG platform represents a new approach to making sensitive
genomic data available to analysis across multiple providers. By
moving computation to the data, we enable truly national-scale
analysis of private health data in Canada, where provincial health
data privacy protections can make it difficult for clinical data
to leave the province it was collected in.  As privacy protections
built in from the very beginning, we make it easier for health data
stewards to justify allowing their data to be part of some remote
analyses. Granular control of the amount of data and information
being released, and to whom, is a fundamental part of the overall
design. Our efforts build on and contribute back to the efforts of
the international Global Alliance for Global Health (GA4GH,
http://genomicsandhealth.org ), using standardized RESTful APIs for
data access to provide interoperability with a wide range of tools,
and web-era authentication and authorization standards (OpenID
Connect and UMA) to ensure privacy and security of all data.
