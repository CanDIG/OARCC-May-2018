# Presentation Materials for CanDIG

This directory contains a template for a
[remark.js](https://github.com/gnab/remark) HTML5 presentation on
CanDIG, with theming and relevant diagrams in both .PNG and editable,
vector, .SVG formats.

By writing a slide deck in markdown in the format demonstrated in the
[example slides](./docs/index.html), putting these on a github repo, and creating github pages
for the repo at ./docs, the slides will be visible as github pages at
https://{username}.github.io/{repo} .

In the [Keynote](./keynote) directory is a Keynote slide deck containing
all of the diagrams here, in Keynote and Powerpoint format, and a Keynote
theme.
